================================
Layout: 
Domain > Application > API > Persistence
(Ex. Persistence depends on API
API depends on Application and applications depends on Domain)
Process:
API (Receive HTTP request and respond them)
Applications (Process Business Logic)
Persistence (Access Database)
Domain (Business Entitys)

================================


1. dotnet new sln
//Because we will manage many applications
2. dotnet new classlib -b Domain
//Because we will need class library file for domain entity
3. dotnet new classlib -b application
//Because we will need a application project
4. dotnet new classlib -b persistance
//Because we will need this for persistanc 
5. dotnet new webapi -n API

===========================================
Add all projects to solution file like
==> dotnet sln add Domain/
